3</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a Lecture on the Jesuits,
recently delivered before the Islington Protestant Institute by
the Rev. <span class="smcap">Edward Hoare</span>, M.A., Incumbent
of Christ Church, Ramsgate, and since published, there occurs the
following passage with the note subjoined:&mdash;&ldquo;It would
not be fair to attach to the Order the opinions of the
individual, unless these can be proved to be fully borne out and
sanctioned by the fixed and authoritative documents of the
Society.&nbsp; Nothing, however, can be clearer, than that the
sentiments then expressed, [<i>i.e.</i>, alleged to have been
expressed on an occasion before referred to], were those not of
the man, but of the Order; for although there is an exceptive
clause inserted in one of the Constitutions, as if for the relief
of unseared consciences, so that the Statute runs thus,
&lsquo;Conforming their will to what the Superior wills and
thinks in all things, where it cannot be defined that any kind of
sin interferes;&rsquo; <a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a> yet a little further
on there is another section wherein that clause is wholly
nullified, and the original principle boldly asserted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Although the Society desires that all its Constitutions,
&amp;c., should be undeviatingly observed, according to the
Institute, it desires, nevertheless, that all its members should
be <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>secured
or at least assisted against falling into the snare of any sin
which may originate from the force of any such Constitutions or
injunctions; therefore, it hath seemed good to us in the Lord,
with the express exception of the vow of obedience to the Pope
for the time being, and the other three fundamental vows of
poverty, chastity, and obedience, to declare that no
Constitutions, declarations, or rule of life, can lead to an
obligation to sin, mortal or venial.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus far all is
well; what more can be required?&nbsp; But now mark the next
passage.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Unless the Superior may command them in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>, <i>or in virtue of the vow
of obedience</i>; <i>and this he may do whenever</i>, <i>and to
whomsoever</i>, <i>he may judge it conducive either to individual
good or to the universal well-being of the Society</i>.&nbsp; And
in the place of the fear of offence, let the love and desire of
all perfection succeed; that the greater glory and praise of
Christ our Creator and Lord may follow.&rsquo;&nbsp; So that the
poor Jesuit may be compelled to commit what he knows to be a
mortal sin at the bidding of his Superior.&nbsp; He may clearly
see it to be utterly opposed to every principle of Scripture; his
own conscience may turn from it with horror; his moral sense may
utterly condemn it; he may see clearly that he is flying in the
face of the most High God; but on he must go, because his
Superior bids him; and in order to obtain an object, which the
Superior considers conducive to the interests of the Society, he
must freely consent to have his deepest convictions wholly
disregarded, and his principles of moral rectitude for ever
crushed within his soul.&rdquo; <a name="citation4"></a><a
href="#footnote4" class="citation">[4]</a></p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>The
present writer is the person alluded to in the note as having
complained of this shocking statement, and stated <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>what is the
true meaning of the Constitution of which it is such an utter
perversion.&nbsp; What he said on the subject forms his portion
of the following correspondence.&nbsp; The publication of the
entire correspondence that passed on the occasion, will, it is
hoped, afford Mr. Hoare&rsquo;s readers the readiest means of
determining for themselves whether the accusation he has brought
is sustainable or not.</p>
<p>The writer may advert here to a consideration which was
overlooked in the course of the correspondence by both Mr. Hoare
and himself.&nbsp; From first to last Mr. Hoare has considered
the question simply with reference to the rules of scholarship;
it is believed, however, that the ordinary principles of
scholarship, <i>i.e.</i>, of classical scholarship, have hardly
any place in the discussion at all, and this for the following
reason:&mdash;Christianity having introduced its new and complex
subject-matter, there followed, in matter of fact, what we should
beforehand expect to find, viz., a corresponding modification of
the language which became its organ.&nbsp; Expression had to be
found for the mind of the Church in a medium to which almost all
her ideas were foreign and strange; she had to adapt it to her
purpose in her own way; new ideas provided for themselves new
forms of language; words were added, existing words acquired new
meanings and were used in new combinations; and by this natural
process there was brought about in the course of years, almost as
great a difference, as regards idiom, between the Latin of the
Church and the classical Latin, as is observable in the case of
any two modern languages having a common origin.&nbsp; The writer
is not a theological student, and is not saying this from his own
knowledge; but he understands from those who are qualified to
speak on the subject, and in whom he places implicit confidence,
that the fact is as he has stated.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>So then,
possibly &ldquo;obligatio ad peccatum,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;an
obligation binding under pain of sin,&rdquo; may displease the
classical Latinist, but it is a term of Theology, and beyond his
province.&nbsp; The question is not how <i>he</i> would express
that meaning in Latin, but how he should construe a particular
phrase which he finds Theologians have adopted.&nbsp; It is used
by Catholic <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a> and Protestant writers alike, and must
be understood as they understand it.&nbsp; Its use by St.
Alphonso was but very lately brought into prominent view: a
writer in the <i>Dublin Review</i> for October last, had occasion
to animadvert on a Protestant author&rsquo;s having translated
these words of St. Alphonso, &ldquo;nullo jure obligante ad
mortale,&rdquo; thus&mdash;&ldquo;by no law that is
obligatory,&rdquo; and so having omitted to render the important
words &ldquo;ad mortale.&rdquo;&nbsp; It appears from a reply by
the Protestant author, that &ldquo;the misprint,&rdquo; as he
calls it, was corrected in a second edition of his work; but that
the phrase meant &ldquo;obligatory under pain of mortal
sin,&rdquo; was admitted on all hands; and this was in a most
adverse quarter.</p>
<p>It will be seen that for so much of the note extracted above
as follows the Latin quotation, Mr. Hoare is not responsible; it
was added, through mistake, by another gentleman.&nbsp; The
circumstance will account for a contrariety of statement to be
observed with reference to Const., part iv, chap, i, but which
does not call for more particular notice.</p>
<p>It is said, with some ambiguity, &ldquo;that the version thus
excepted against is by no means an exclusively Protestant one,
but has been adopted by most competent Roman Catholic
authorities;&rdquo; and Dr. Wordsworth&rsquo;s work seems <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>to be referred
to in behalf of the statement.&nbsp; It will be found, however,
that the &ldquo;historical research&rdquo; of that writer has
only enabled him to adduce the instance of Stephen Pasquier, who
is said to have given the version in a speech which he made as an
advocate in a cause, in which the Jesuits were his
opponents.&nbsp; In the <i>Biographie Universelle</i>, Stephen
Pasquier is spoken of as &ldquo;un homme passion&eacute;,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;en titre adversaire des Jesuites.&rdquo; <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>With Mr. Hoare&rsquo;s Lecture as a whole, the writer is not
concerned: the friend, a Protestant, who kindly directed his
attention to the single statement which he has exposed, informed
him at the same time that there was little besides in the lecture
that seemed to him to call for notice; a cursory glance over its
pages has satisfied the writer of the correctness of that view;
and statements which few, surely, can believe, will, he trusts,
produce in the minds of readers an effect the very reverse of
that intended.</p>

9</span>CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">12, Manor Road, Upper Holloway,<br
/>
Feast of the Immaculate Conception, 1851.</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I will not make an acquaintance so slight as ours with each
other my excuse for this letter, but rather hope that my object
in writing it&mdash;viz., the removal of a very great
misapprehension&mdash;will, of itself, prevent your regarding it
as an intrusion.&nbsp; A friend of mine, a protestant, was
present at the lecture which you recently delivered in Islington
on the Jesuits, and I learn from him that you stated, that, by
the Constitutions of the Society of Jesus, the members of the
society may actually be commanded by their Superiors to commit
mortal sin.&nbsp; I do not understand from my friend that you
cited any passage from the Constitutions in support of this
fearful statement: I venture to think it most likely that you
were content to make it on the authority of some, perhaps,
respectable name, but, as not doubting its correctness, without
referring to the Constitutions to verify it.&nbsp; I believe the
passage on which the statement has been made to rest is to be
found in Const. part vi., chap. 5, which Dr. Wordsworth and
others have construed to mean what you say: Dr. Wordsworth having
altered the text for the purpose.</p>
<p>Now I confidently submit that the true version of that passage
is&mdash;The Constitutions do not bind under pain of mortal or
venial sin, unless the Superior commands the observance of them
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>May I
not fairly hope that you will look into the matter?&nbsp; I make
the request for truth&rsquo;s sake and charity&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; Some of the lectures delivered before the Islington
Protestant Institute are, I know, afterwards published; two
delivered by you have been published; I feel sure that I shall
not have the pain of seeing this last go forth with the
statement, which I have thus taken the liberty of asking you to
reconsider, uncorrected.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am, my dear Sir,<br />
Yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap">Henry Waller</span>.</p>
<p>Rev. Edward Hoare.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Ramsgate,<br />
Dec. 11, 1851.</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>You need make no apology for writing to me on the subject of
my lecture, and I am much obliged to you for so doing, as I
cordially desire to elicit truth and <i>nothing else</i>.&nbsp;
The passage which I quoted was, as you suppose, the 5th chap. of
the 6th part of the Constitutions, and my authority is an edition
of the Constitutions published by Rivington in 1838, which I have
compared since your note with the extracts given in
Taylor&rsquo;s Loyola, who has evidently used another edition,
though differing in no essential particular.</p>
<p>I have also carefully examined the passage with your
exposition before me, and submitted it to some of the best
scholars that I know; but I confess myself quite at a loss to
translate the words in the original so as to force upon them the
meaning which you think they are intended to convey.&nbsp; Surely
the expression, &ldquo;Obligationem ad peccatum mortale vel
veniale inducere,&rdquo; makes sin the object of the obligation,
and does not merely describe the character of the fault.&nbsp; If
the words were, <i>peccati mortalis</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, instead
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of
&ldquo;ad peccatum, &amp;c.,&rdquo; I think that the passage
would have borne your interpretation, but as it stands, I must
still believe that the version which I gave of it was
correct.&nbsp; I cannot therefore expunge it from my lecture; but
as I sincerely desire to make no false charge against an
opponent, I will subjoin the Latin copy, so that any scholars may
be able to decide as to the merits of the question.</p>
<p>I cannot close my note without adding the expression of my
deep and heartfelt sorrow that you have been led to abandon the
truth in which you were trained, for the, as I believe,
unscriptural system of the Church of Rome.&nbsp; Putting all
other considerations out of the question, it is enough to my mind
to condemn the whole system when I find it adopting the company
of Jesuits, of whose morality and mischievous intrigues it had
already had, according to Clement XIV., such mournful
experience.</p>
<p>Earnestly hoping that the Lord may guide you into the way of
truth,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain, dear Sir,<br />
Very faithfully yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Edward Hoare</span>.</p>
<p>H. Waller, Esq.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">8, New Square, Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn,<br />
Dec. 1851.</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have to thank you for the manner in which you have received
my communication, but I am sorry to find that, contrary to my
expectation, a simple reference to the original text of the
Constitutions has not sufficed to show you that the version for
which you contend is, as I still believe I shall be able to
convince you, founded in misapprehension.&nbsp; I attribute to
you&mdash;I am bound to attribute to you a <i>wish</i> to see it
satisfactorily proved, that the <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>passage has not the dreadful sense
which has been given it, and which you assign to it simply
because it seems to you unavoidable.&nbsp; I cannot think, then,
that I have a difficult task to accomplish.</p>
<p>In several places in the Constitutions the expressions,
&ldquo;obligatio ad peccatum,&rdquo; &ldquo;obligatio
peccati,&rdquo; and &ldquo;obligatio sub p&oelig;n&acirc;
peccati,&rdquo; are used indifferently, as equivalent to one
another.&nbsp; Thus, the title of cap. v., pars vi., itself is,
&ldquo;Quod Constitutiones peccati obligationem non
inducunt;&rdquo; obviously the same thing must be meant as by,
&ldquo;obligatio ad peccatum,&rdquo; in the chapter itself.&nbsp;
Now you admit that, &ldquo;obligatio peccati&rdquo; has the same
meaning as &ldquo;obligatio sub p&oelig;n&acirc; peccati;&rdquo;
surely then &ldquo;obligatio ad peccatum&rdquo; has the same
meaning too.</p>
<p>In pars ix., c. v., &sect; 6, the following passage occurs:
&ldquo;si non compulerit talis obedientia Summi Pontificis,
<i>qu&aelig; ad peccatum obligare posset</i>;&rdquo; even in the
translation which accompanies the edition of the Constitutions to
which you have referred me, this is rendered, &ldquo;unless such
obedience to the Pope, as is <i>compulsive under the penalty of
sin</i>, oblige him, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; What could have led the
translator to put a different meaning on the same expression in
the passage we are discussing, I cannot conceive, except I impute
it to prejudice.</p>
<p>I do not deny that <i>obligare ad aliquid</i> frequently means
<i>to oblige a person to do something</i>; but I deny that it
does or, construed with all the context, <i>can</i> mean this in
the particular passage.&nbsp; I would beg you to consider the
whole chapter, which, I really must say, is turned, not only into
something fearful, but into something quite absurd by the
construction you give it.&nbsp; Only reflect on the frightful
incongruity of any one commanding another to commit sin in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the person of <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>whom this is
required complying through love and a desire of all
perfection.&nbsp; I hope you will say that this had escaped your
notice, not tell me that to urge it is begging the
question.&nbsp; Pray read the entire chapter in accordance with
the version Catholics give of the passage in question, (if that
is to be called a version which simply declares its meaning,) and
I still entertain a hope that you will discover its excellent
purport and intention.</p>
<p>I may observe, though I do so with some diffidence, as I have
almost forgotten my grammar, that in order to make the passage
bear the sense which you put on it, the pronoun &ldquo;ea&rdquo;
should be, not in the plural but the singular, as I presume you
refer it to &ldquo;peccatum mortale vel veniale,&rdquo; which is
disjunctive; and then should be, not <i>id</i> but
<i>hoc</i>.</p>
<p>I find that many Protestant writers have repudiated, or at
least not adopted, the bad meaning.&nbsp; Thus, Steinmetz in his
Novitiate says: &ldquo;Part vi., c. 5.&mdash;Where it is decided,
that the guilt of sin attached to disobedience when the superior
commands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, or in virtue of
obedience.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Novitiate</i>, p. 98, 2nd ed.
1847.&nbsp; And in his History of the Jesuits, he does not, so
far as I have been able to find, say anything different.</p>
<p>I might say more in vindication of the Constitutions of the
Jesuits, but I think I have said enough to justify an expectation
that you will be convinced of the incorrectness of your
statement.</p>
<p>As to what you say at the end of your letter, permit me to
remark, that I abandoned no positive doctrine [in which I had
been trained], in embracing the Catholic faith; and as to the
hope which you very kindly express, that the Lord may guide me
into the way of truth, I must tell you that when <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>God led me in
a remarkable manner into His Church, which is &ldquo;the ground
and pillar of the truth,&rdquo; He put me on that way, and that
it &ldquo;is the way,&rdquo; <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a> I have an internal
and external assurance which, I know, cannot be had in
protestantism.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain, my dear Sir,<br />
Yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap">Henry Waller</span>.</p>
<p>Rev. Edward Hoare.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Ramsgate,<br />
Dec. 22, 1851.</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I thank you very much for your full communication, and I fear
that you will think me very much prejudiced when I state that
whatever were the intention of the writer, I still think that the
version which I have given is most in accordance with the
Latin.</p>
<p>With reference to your criticisms, I have read the
constitutions carefully, and I cannot agree with you that the
expressions &ldquo;obligatio ad
peccatum&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;peccati&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;sub
p&oelig;n&acirc; peccati&rdquo;&mdash;are used indifferently in
any other portion of the book, unless it be the extract quoted by
you from the 9th part.&nbsp; This appears to me a very important
extract, and is the only thing which has at all shaken my
opinion.&nbsp; I am, however, exceedingly doubtful whether the
translator has given its true meaning, while at the same time I
fully admit that his having so translated it is a strong and
valid argument in favour of your interpretation.</p>
<p>With reference to your two other points, I certainly think
that the words &ldquo;obligatio peccati&rdquo; might include
either sense; so that the utmost that can be gathered from <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the heading
is that as far as it is concerned the section may bear the
harmless sense, but whether it does or not must be decided by the
contents.</p>
<p>I had noticed the &ldquo;ea&rdquo; before you mentioned it,
and you will perhaps be surprised at hearing that it failed to
carry conviction to my mind.&nbsp; It does not agree with
peccatum, but what does it agree with unless it be with
&ldquo;Constitutiones, &amp;c.&rdquo;; and if it does, the
meaning is not at all altered, as it is the &ldquo;vis
constitutionum&rdquo; by which the Jesuit is to be drawn
&ldquo;in Iaqueum peccati.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then again, if this be the meaning of the passage, it appears
to me very strange that it should be placed just after the
chapter on obedience, in the middle of the Constitutions, and not
at the commencement or close of the book.&nbsp; It certainly is a
very extraordinary place for it, if it really describes the
obligatory force of the whole code.</p>
<p>On the whole, therefore, I confess myself very much at a loss
upon the subject, and am inclined to think that very possibly it
may be understood by members of the Society in the sense in which
you apply it, while on the other hand I am thoroughly convinced
that the majority of Latin scholars would translate it as I did
in my lecture.&nbsp; I cannot therefore withdraw it, because I am
not prepared to acknowledge any inaccuracy in my version; but I
will subjoin the Latin, and add the reference from the 9th Part,
so that the matter may be fairly presented to the reader.</p>
<p>Once more thanking you for your communication, and deeply
regretting our difference of opinion on the great questions
affecting Christian truth,</p>

<p>The festivals of this holy season have not left me leisure to
reply to your letter as I ought, until now, and deeply I regret
that it should not have called for a different answer from
this.&nbsp; When I wrote last, I submitted for your
consideration, not all that occurred to me in behalf of the true
meaning of the Constitution, but so much as it seemed to me might
be urged without implying a misgiving as to the charity and
fairness of mind of the person to whom it should be
addressed,&mdash;a misgiving I am unwilling to entertain with
regard to you or any one.&nbsp; But it is, I confess, with
greatly diminished confidence as to the result of what I shall
say, that I now proceed to add to what I have said already.</p>
<p>When you say that whatever were the intention of the writer,
you think the version you have given of the passage is most in
accordance with the Latin, and that though very possibly it may
be differently understood by members of the Society, you are
convinced that the majority of Latin scholars would translate it
as you do, you surely forget that the question we are concerned
with is, not one of scholarship, not one of mere words, but
simply a question of fact,&mdash;What is the Constitution?&nbsp;
The question is precisely, What did the founder mean, what do the
members understand?&nbsp; What he meant, and what they
understand, that the Constitution is and nothing else.</p>
<p>However, as a mere question of Latin I should have no reason
to fear the result of an appeal to scholars, for those to whom I
have submitted it, two Oxford men and a Cambridge man, and all
Protestants, agree in construing the passage as I do; on the
other hand, I suppose I may <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>safely assert that you cannot produce
any Catholic authority for the correctness of your
version&mdash;not even Pascal.</p>
<p>But supposing the words capable of receiving the sense which
you impute to them, surely you are not therefore justified in
making your statement, if, as you seem to allow, another and an
unexceptionable meaning is also admissible.&nbsp; Ambiguity, in
some degree or other, is a property of all language, even of
inspired language; the fact does not leave us at liberty to
choose which of several possible meanings we will, but obliges us
to have recourse to recognised principles of construction, to
ascertain the determinate meaning of the author.</p>
<p>Every fair principle of interpretation with which I am
acquainted seems to me to be disregarded in your translation.</p>
<p>Here, then, I will cite a passage from a work of the greatest
authority, Rodriguez on Christian Perfection: Rodriguez was
himself a Jesuit, and speaks thus of the Constitution in
question: first there is this heading, &ldquo;That though our
rules do not oblige under penalty of sin, yet nevertheless we
ought exactly to observe them&rdquo;; and then he proceeds,
&ldquo;Our Rules and Constitutions,&rdquo; he is speaking of the
Society of Jesus, &ldquo;do not oblige us under pain of mortal
sin, nor even of venial, no more than the commands of our
Superiors, unless it be, as our Constitutions declare, when they
command on God&rsquo;s part or by virtue of holy obedience.&nbsp;
Yet we ought to take heed, lest for this reason we come to
neglect them, &amp;c.&nbsp; Our holy founder would not on the one
side bind us so fast as might give us an occasion of sin, and on
the other, being desirous to move us to an exact observance of
them, with all possible perfection, he gives us this wholesome
advice.&nbsp; <i>Let the love of God</i>, says he, <i>succeed in
the place of the fear of offending </i><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span><i>him</i>, <i>and let it be the
desire of your greater perfection</i>, <i>and the greater glory
of God</i>, <i>that moves us to perform your duty
herein</i>.&nbsp; He says also, in the beginning of our Rules and
Constitutions, that the interior law of charity, which the Holy
Ghost has writ in our hearts, ought to move us to an exact
observance of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Third Part, Treat. 6, chap,
iii, p. 350, ed. Lond., 1699.)</p>
<p>How are we ever to arrive at the sense of a document, if we
are not to be guided by the understanding of those whose position
enables them to speak with most knowledge of its subject-matter,
[intention, and end]?&nbsp; Ask the meaning of the chapter in
whatever quarter of the Church you will, and but one reply will
be made.</p>
<p>I cannot at all agree with you, that having this meaning the
chapter is misplaced; on the contrary, I know not where a more
fit place could be found for it.</p>
<p>Since you are doubtful as to the meaning of &ldquo;obligare ad
peccatum&rdquo; in the place to which I have referred you, I can
hardly hope that you will look more favourably upon the
expression in two other places in which it occurs,
viz.,&mdash;Pars. ix, cap. iv, &sect; 5, and cap. v, &sect;
6.&nbsp; But I have to submit to you the following sentence from
the Protestant Bishop Sanderson&rsquo;s Pr&aelig;lectiones:
&ldquo;omnis enim obligatio aut ad culpam est aut ad p&oelig;nam,
vel etiam utramque.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Pr&aelig;l. vi, p. 154, ed.
Lond., 1686.)&nbsp; I shall never be induced to give this a bad
meaning.</p>
<p>I imagined that you referred the pronoun &ldquo;ea&rdquo; to
&ldquo;peccatum mortale vel veniale,&rdquo; because I found that
Dr. Wordsworth did so in rendering the passage as you do; he,
with much cleverness, altered <i>ea</i> into <i>id</i>.</p>
<p>I regret the length to which my letter has extended; I had
indeed hoped that our correspondence by this time would have been
brought to a more agreeable issue.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>With
reference to an expression at the conclusion of your letter, I
must protest against your supposing that the Catholic faith is
simply commensurate with our judgments, like Protestantism, and
has no surer basis than opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain, my dear Sir,<br />

<p style="text-align: right">Ramsgate,<br />
January 5, 1852.</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am sorry that you do not think me candid in the
consideration of the Constitution, for I have heartily desired to
ascertain the truth, and perhaps you will allow me to suggest
that where there is a difference of opinion it is scarcely fair
to attribute it to want of fairness of mind in the
discussion.</p>
<p>The fact is, that I have given the subject much anxious study,
and you will perhaps be surprised when I tell you, that my
opinion is less shaken than it was when I wrote last, so that
when I had to revise the proof I erased a part of the note that I
had previously written, and have now simply stated your opinion
and added the Latin.</p>
<p>With reference to your last letter I think that you can
scarcely have referred to the two passages which you mention as
containing the expression&mdash;&ldquo;obligatio ad
peccatum;&rdquo; for in the one (ix, iv, 5.) the words
are&mdash;&ldquo;sub p&oelig;n&acirc; peccati,&rdquo; and the
other (ix, v, 6.) is the very one already under discussion.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>I have
not the edition of Bishop Sanderson to which you refer, but if
you think it worth while to let me know the prelection in which
the words occur, I will endeavour to examine them, though I am
not sure I shall be able, as I have not all of them within
reach.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine what I should have said which has led to the
idea&mdash;&ldquo;that the Catholic faith is commensurate with
our judgments, and has no surer basis than opinion;&rdquo; the
basis of the Gospel is the revealed word of God, and that remains
the same whatever be man&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">8, New Square, Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn,<br />
January 8, 1852.</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I greatly regret my carelessness in having given you such
faulty references.&nbsp; Instead of referring to the
<i>Constitutions</i>, part ix, c. iv, &sect; 8, and c. v, &sect;
6, I should have referred to the <i>Declarations</i>
corresponding to those passages.&nbsp; In the first passage,
where the Constitutions have, as you say, &ldquo;obligando sub
p&oelig;n&acirc; peccati,&rdquo; the corresponding declaration
says, &ldquo;nec Societas approbabit, si Pontifex pr&aelig;cepto
quod ad peccatum obliget, non compelleret.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to
part ix, c. v, &sect; 6, to which I referred you in a previous
letter, I find that the declaration has the same expression as
the Constitution.&nbsp; There is still another place in the
Constitutions in which &ldquo;ad peccatum obligare&rdquo; occurs,
viz., <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>pars
vi, cap. iii, &sect; 8, and here it is again correctly rendered
in the translation published by Rivington; thus the author of
that translation has twice given the phrase its true
meaning.&nbsp; In the declaration on the Examen Generale the
expression also occurs,&mdash;&ldquo;obligatio vera dicendi in
examine, ad peccatum esse debet,&rdquo; (cap. iii, &sect; 1.) and
the meaning is plain.&nbsp; I have quoted from the Prague edition
of 1757.&nbsp; I am aware that the edition published by Rivington
does not contain the declarations.</p>
<p>My reference for the sentence out of Sanderson might have been
more complete.&nbsp; It is to be found in the Pr&aelig;lectiones
de Conscienti&aelig; Obligatione, pr&aelig;l. vi, &sect; 6, p.
156 of the ed. Lond. 1696; the sentence is a parenthesis and
independent of the context:&mdash;&ldquo;Nemo potest jure
obligari ad id faciendum, cujus omissio non potest ei imputari ad
culpam nec debet ei imputari ad p&oelig;nam; (omnis enim
obligatio aut ad culpam est aut ad p&oelig;nam, vel etiam
utramque) sed rei impossibilis omissio non potest alicui imputari
ad culpam.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have found the same expression in the
other work of Sanderson, De Juramenti Obligatione.&nbsp; I must
beg you to excuse the length of the following
extract:&mdash;&ldquo;Pr&aelig;ter illam obligationis
distinctionem ex origne natam, per respectum ad Jus unde oritur
obligatio: est et alia ab objecto sumpta per respectum scil. ad
debitum solvendum, quo tendit et in quod fertur obligatio.&nbsp;
Duplex autem est debitum.&nbsp; Debitum officii, quod quis ex
pr&aelig;cepto juris tenetur facere: et Debitum supplicii, quod
quis ex sanctione juris tenetur pati, si officium suum
neglexerit.&nbsp; Priori sensu dicimus mutua caritatis officia
esse debita, quia lex Dei illa pr&aelig;cipit, juxta illud, Rom.
xiii.&nbsp; <i>Nihil cuiquam debete</i>, <i>nisi ut diligatis
invicem</i>.&nbsp; Posteriori sensu dicimus peccata esse debita
ut in oratione Dominica, <i>Dimitte nobis</i>, &amp;c. et mortem
&aelig;ternam esse debitam, juxta <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>illud, Rom. vi.&nbsp; <i>Stipendium
peccati mors</i>.&nbsp; Observandum tamen debitum posterius
contrahi ex insoluto priori: ita ut siquis Debitum officii
plenarie dissolveret, faciendo id quod lex imperat, non teneretur
aliquo debito supplicii ad patiendum id quod lex minatur.&nbsp;
Respondet duplici huic debito duplex item obligatio scil. ad
officium faciendum; et obligatio ad supplicium preferendum:
<i>vel quod communiter dicitur et eodem recidit</i>, <i>obligatio
ad culpam</i>, <i>et obligatio ad
p&aelig;nam</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;(De Juramenti Obligatione,
pr&aelig;l. 1, &sect; 12, ed. Lond. 1696.)</p>
<p>What I said at the end of my last letter had reference to an
expression of yours with regard to the faith&mdash;&ldquo;our
difference of opinion&rdquo;&mdash;which seemed to me
objectionable, as being what is called latitudinarian; it was,
perhaps, unduly observed upon by me.</p>

<p>I have procured your Lecture, and read the statement which led
to our correspondence, together with the note which you have
subjoined as the result of it.</p>
<p>I cannot but feel surprised at the character of that
note.&nbsp; There has been such an acknowledgment, on your part,
of doubt on the subject, that I think I was justified in
expecting some reference to it, and to the grounds of it, and
then, either an admission of continued doubt, or, if so it be, a
statement of the considerations which removed it.&nbsp; Under all
the circumstances I feel that, should I think proper to do so, I
shall be justified in giving publicity to the correspondence
which has taken place.&nbsp; Very deeply lamenting its most
painful issue,</p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>With reference to your letter of the 13th, forwarded to me
from Ramsgate, I think it due to myself to inform you that I had
nothing whatever to do with any portion of the note in question,
except the passage extending to the end of the Latin quotation,
which is exactly what I told you in my last letter I intended to
insert.&nbsp; The remainder was added through a very great
mistake on the part of &mdash;, but it was not in the copy which
I transmitted to the <a name="page24"></a><span

you were when I saw it in the published lecture.</p>
<p>Should you publish my correspondence, you will of course take
care to acquaint your readers with its private character, and to
inform them that the letters, having been written without the
least idea of publication, do not contain any attempt at a
complete discussion of the subject, but are merely the expression
of my varying thoughts during the process of careful
investigation.</p>

lecture, a Roman Catholic gentleman has complained of the use
then made of this Constitution, and stated that it means
&ldquo;that the Constitutions do not bind under pain of mortal or
venial sin, unless,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; I cannot undertake to
decide what may have been the <i>intentions</i> of the author,
but I can fearlessly appeal to the opinion of any Latin scholar
as to the grammatical accuracy of the translation given
above.&nbsp; The original is as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Cum exoptet
Societas universas suas Constitutiones, declarationes, ac vivendi
ordinem, omnino juxta nostrum Institutum, nihil ulla in re
declinando, observari; optet etiam nihilominus suos omnes securos
esse, vel cert&egrave; adjuvari, ne in laqueum ullius peccati,
quod ex vi Constitutionum hujusmodi, aut ordinationum proveniat,
incidant: Visum est nobis in Domino pr&aelig;ter expressum votum,
quo Societas Summo Pontifici, pro tempore existenti, tenetur, ac
tria alia essentialia paupertatis, castitatis, et
obedienti&aelig;, nullas Constitutiones, Declarationes, vel
ordinem ullum vivendi, posse obligationem ad peccatum mortale vel
veniale inducere; nisi Superior ea in nomine Domini Nostri Jesu
Christi, vel in virtute obedienti&aelig; juberet: quod in rebus,
vel personis illis, in quibus judicabitur, quod ad particulare

poterit: [et loco timoris offens&aelig;, succedat amor et
desiderium omnis perfectionis; et ut major gloria et laus Christi
Creatoris ac Domini Nostri consequatur].&rsquo;&nbsp; With the
single additional remark, that the version thus excepted against
is by no means an exclusively Protestant one, but has been
adopted by most competent Roman Catholic authorities, I would
earnestly recommend to my readers, of either communion, the
perusal of the third letter in the Rev. Canon Wordsworth&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sequel to Letters to M. Gordon,&rsquo; where this very
Constitution and this same objection are fully discussed and
disposed of.&nbsp; Supposing, however, that the criticism, the
logic, and the historical research of that eminently learned
divine should fail to satisfy the Roman Catholic reader, let him
substitute for the above <i>supposed</i> doubtful passage the
following, respecting which there can be no dispute: &lsquo;They
should permit themselves to be moved and directed, under Divine
Providence, by their Superiors, just as if they were a corpse,
which allows itself to be moved and handled in any way, or as the
staff of an old man, which serves him whenever and in whatever
thing he who holds it in his hand pleases to use

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
